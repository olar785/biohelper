\usage{
taxo_normalisation(
  obj,
  sqlFile_path,
  addExtra = T,
  spnc = F,
  ranks = c("Superkingdom", "Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus",
    "Species")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{= Either a dataframe containing taxonomic information (e.g. output of Qiime2 or the assignTaxonomy from dada2) or a phyloseq object}

\item{sqlFile_path}{= Path to the local NCBI taxonomy db}

\item{addExtra}{= Currently adds the Protozoa and Archaeplastida (excl. Viridiplantae) groups under the Kingdom rank (default is TRUE). This is to make it easier to dissociate the Plantea and Protozoa group from Metazoans}

\item{spnc}{= Only needs to be applied if the Genus is not present under the Species column (default is FALSE).}

\item{ranks}{= Ranks to return}
}
\description{
This function performs normalisation of taxonomic assignments of eukaryotic data
identified via silva, midori or any other reference databases, using NCBI curated
classification and nomenclature database. It can also provide further taxonomic
information of additional desired ranks. It can either take in a taxonomy table
(e.g. from Qiime2) or a phyloseq object. For species assignation, make sure that
the species column contains both the Genus and Species names. If it doesn't, use "spnc = T".

Importantly, this function requires the download of NCBI taxonomic database.

This takes few minutes to install using the following command:\cr
prepareDatabase('accessionTaxa.sql') # From the taxonomizr R package. The database is ~65 GB but the user can set getAccessions=FALSE to drastically reduce its size.
}
\examples{
data("ps_test_data")
taxo_normalisation(ps_test_data, sqlFile_path = 'accessionTaxa.sql')

}
