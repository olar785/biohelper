#' The psmelt function is a specialized melt function for melting phyloseq
#' objects (instances of the phyloseq class), usually for producing graphics
#' with [ggplot2::ggplot2]. The naming conventions used in downstream phyloseq
#' graphics functions have reserved the following variable names that should
#' not be used as the names of [sample_variables()] or taxonomic
#' [rank_names()]. These reserved names are `c("Sample", "Abundance", "OTU")`.
#' Also, you should not have identical names for sample variables and taxonomic
#' ranks. That is, the intersection of the output of the following two
#' functions [sample_variables()], [rank_names()] should be an empty vector
#' (e.g.  `intersect(sample_variables(physeq), rank_names(physeq))`). All of
#' these potential name collisions are checked-for and renamed automatically
#' with a warning. However, if you (re)name your variables accordingly ahead of
#' time, it will reduce confusion and eliminate the warnings.
#'
#' The `as` argument allows choosing between three classes for tabular data:
#'
#' - [data.frame-class] is chosen by "data.frame" or "df"
#' - [data.table-class] is chosen by "data.table" or "dt"
#' - [tbl_df-class] is chosen by "tbl_df", "tbl", or "tibble"
#'
#' The default is "data.frame" and can be overridden by setting the
#' "speedyseq.psmelt_class" option.
#'
#' Note that "melted" phyloseq data is stored much less efficiently, and so RAM
#' storage issues could arise with a smaller dataset (smaller number of
#' samples/OTUs/variables) than one might otherwise expect.  For common sizes
#' of graphics-ready datasets, however, this should not be a problem.  Because
#' the number of OTU entries has a large effect on the RAM requirement, methods
#' to reduce the number of separate OTU entries -- for instance by
#' agglomerating OTUs based on phylogenetic distance using [tip_glom()] -- can
#' help alleviate RAM usage problems. This function is made user-accessible for
#' flexibility, but is also used extensively by plot functions in phyloseq.
